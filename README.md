# Arcaea Web Project
This is the web project for the Arcaea mobile game. The idea is to create a website that allows players to fetch the information about songs, characters, and any other elements of the game. 

## Daily Updates

Date: 2025.1.25
- [x] Add level filter.
- [x] All the filters has been added.
  
## Tomorrow's Plan
- Song list.
- Song detail page.

## Note
Since multi-selection will be very ugly if using `multiple` attribute, I will use checkboxes instead later in the dynamic front-end stage.

## Reference
The project is inspired by [this website](https://arcade-songs.zetaraku.dev/maimai/). It provides a good reference for the design and functionality of the website about acrade music games.
