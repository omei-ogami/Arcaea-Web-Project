# Arcaea Web Project
This is the web project for the Arcaea mobile game. The idea is to create a website that allows players to fetch the information about songs, characters, and any other elements of the game. 

## Daily Updates

Date: 2025.1.28
- [x] Add filters except name searching.
- [x] Filters also apply to the random button.
  
## Tomorrow's Plan
- Generate song information in JSON format.
  * Lasting Eden
- Operating the name searching filter.

## Note
* Since multi-selection will be very ugly if using `multiple` attribute, I will use checkboxes instead later in the dynamic front-end stage.
